I am currently Master of Architecture candidate at UC Berkeley [CED](https://ced.berkeley.edu/), pursing  Graduate Certificate in [Applied Data Science](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/data-science-certificate) and [Geospatial Information Science and Technology](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/graduatethe-phd-program/geospatial-information-science-and-technology).

My passion lies in the intersection of data science, transportation planning, healthcities, and sustainable infrastructure systems. Through modeling, visualization, andstorytelling, my work aims to generate insights that support more inclusive and resilienturban futures.

Before entering UC Berkeley, l had one year of experience studying [chemistry](https://chem.hust.edu.cn/index.htm) and received a Bachelor of Architecture from Huazhong University of Science andTechnology.
