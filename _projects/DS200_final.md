This project applies machine learning techniques to automate disaster type classification and damage level assessment based on satellite imagery. Using logistic regression and XGBoost, the models were trained to distinguish between flooding and wildfire events, and to classify structural damage caused by Hurricane Matthew. Through feature extraction techniques such as LBP, Gabor filters, and RGB histograms, the models achieved high performance while remaining lightweight and interpretable. This study demonstrates how computer visionâ€“aided machine learning can support efficient, scalable, and timely disaster response planning.
