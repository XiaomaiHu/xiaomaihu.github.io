Situated at the emerging urban edge of Yizhuang—a former industrial area transforming into Beijing's next-generation satellite hub—this urban design initiative capitalizes on the expansion of dual metro lines to redefine suburban development. The proposal introduces a triaxial framework that aligns transit connectivity, ecological corridors, and community networks, challenging China’s conventional 300m superblock model.

By implementing 80-120m hybrid blocks with mixed-use programming, the design focuses on pedestrian-oriented streetscapes and integrated water systems. Strategic interventions include transit-oriented hubs, bioengineered riparian edges, and phased development plots, fostering a symbiotic relationship between urban density and blue-green infrastructure. This approach offers a replicable model for ecological resilience in rapidly urbanizing settings.
