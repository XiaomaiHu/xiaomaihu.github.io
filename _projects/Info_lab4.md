This project evaluates the impact of Mexico’s flagship conditional cash transfer program, PROGRESA, on school enrollment rates among children in rural communities. Leveraging a natural experiment where some eligible villages received the program before others, we apply a difference-in-differences (DID) approach to estimate causal effects. Using household-level panel data from 1997 to 1998, our analysis reveals how financial incentives tied to school attendance influenced educational outcomes. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of how targeted welfare programs can break the cycle of poverty by encouraging human capital investment through schooling.
