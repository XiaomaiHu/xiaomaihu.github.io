This project seeks to achieve a balance between accommo-dating modern lifestyles and maintaining the continuity of traditional spatial narratives. It involves studying the evolution of residential architecture in Europe and Japan, along with the structural characteristics of local dwellings, to identify adaptable design solutions for the Cantonese context. 

The proposal introduces a new concrete volume into the existing institutionalized house, where the service space is isolated and concentrated within thickened walls, simultaneously restructuring the village and projecting it forward. Additionally, the project redefines the relationship between solid and void, emphasizing the interconnectedness of housing units. Ultimately, it offers an alternative vision for ancient villages, projecting a future for Chinaâ€™s historic settlements through subtle interventions.
